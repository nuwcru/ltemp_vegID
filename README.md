## Simple GUI to process historical Vegetation images from the Qamanirjuaq calving grounds

The GUI is launched from the command line: ```python3 main.py```

Example images are currently stored in ```images/grid_Heath AA - R1Z1 2019_completed.JPG```. This is useable, but very rough version of what we would hope to roll out. For discussions about what changes would need to be made, please contact Erik Hedlin.
